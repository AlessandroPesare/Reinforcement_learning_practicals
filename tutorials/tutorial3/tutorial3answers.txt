Question 3:
mc/ctrl/ratio – Importance-sampling ratio in off-policy MC con- trol.
In the off-policy MC-control algorithm in [1, Section 5.7], the importance- sampling ratio is updated according to
𝑊∶= 𝑊 , 𝑏(𝐴𝑡|𝑆𝑡)
although the definition of the importance-sampling ratio 𝜌𝑡∶𝑇 −1 implies 𝑊 ∶= 𝜋(𝐴𝑡|𝑆𝑡)𝑊.
𝑏(𝐴𝑡|𝑆𝑡)
Why is the update in the algorithm nevertheless correct?

Because π is a deterministic 0–1 policy, any time π would insert a factor 0 you break and stop accumulating.
On the steps you do accumulate, π=1, so
π/b=1/b
and W←W/b(At∣St)
